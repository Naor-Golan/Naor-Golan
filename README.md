## Hello weary travelerðŸ‘‹

# Cybersecurity student @ RIT â€¢ CPTC CTF Competitor â€¢ Pentester (Active Directory focused) â€¢ Reverse Engineer â€¢ Malware Analysis â€¢ SDR & Hardware tinkerer

My name is Naor Golan, and Iâ€™m a cybersecurity student at RIT with a passion for breaking, tinkering, and understanding systems. From Active Directory pentesting to reverse engineering and malware analysis (such as AgentTesla) to analyzing car key fob and other signals, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity for how things work, and how to make them work differently.
